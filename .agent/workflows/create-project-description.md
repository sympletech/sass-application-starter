<objective>
Produce a detailed and well documented .project-plan/PROJECT-DESCRIPTION.md
</objective>

<process>

## 1. Interview User
- Ask user for a general description of the project
- Ask probing questions until you have enough information to produce a detailed and well documented .project-plan/PROJECT-DESCRIPTION.md
- Allow user to review the project description and make any changes

## 2. Create Roadmap
- Once you have created a detailed and well documented .project-plan/PROJECT-DESCRIPTION.md use that information to make an initial .project-plan/ROADMAP.md
- The roadmap should be broken down into clear tasks with a well defined execution path
