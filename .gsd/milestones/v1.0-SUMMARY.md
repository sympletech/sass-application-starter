## Lessons Learned
- **Hybrid CSS Approach**: Combining Ant Design `ConfigProvider` with custom CSS variables (Option A+B) allowed for a highly customized "premium" look while maintaining functional layout primitives.
- **Glassmorphism**: Applying glassmorphism to the header and auth cards significantly elevated the visual quality.
- **Micro-animations**: Intersection observers and CSS keyframes provided the "bold" feel requested.
- **Scroll Management**: Implementing a `ScrollToTop` component was crucial for a seamless experience when navigating between long pages.
