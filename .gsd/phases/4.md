# Phase 4: Final Polish & Launch

## Objective
Apply the final layer of "WOW" factor with bold animations, glassmorphism on auth pages, and a final responsive audit.

## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Bold Motion System (CSS)**
  - Add `reveal` keyframes (slide + fade) to `index.css`.
  - Implement enhanced hover states for `glass-card`:
    - `transform: translateY(-8px) scale(1.02);`
    - `box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.2);`
- [ ] **Task 2: Intersection Observer implementation**
  - Create a simple helper to apply `.reveal-visible` classes to elements when they enter the viewport.
  - Apply to Hero, Feature cards, and Pricing cards.
- [ ] **Task 3: Glassmorphism Auth Pages**
  - Refactor `@client/src/components/auth/AuthCard.css` to use `var(--glass-bg)` and `var(--glass-blur)`.
  - Ensure the "Sympletech" gradient branding is consistent on Auth pages.
- [ ] **Task 4: Final Verification**
  - Perform a complete walkthrough of all public routes.
  - Verify `prefers-reduced-motion` compatibility.
  - Empirical verification of the "Bold" aesthetic.

## Verification Criteria
- [ ] Content "slides in" beautifully as the user scrolls.
- [ ] Feature and Pricing cards have a distinct, high-end hover state.
- [ ] Login and Signup pages feature the glassmorphism aesthetic.
- [ ] Responsive behavior is flawless on mobile and desktop.
