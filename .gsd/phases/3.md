# Phase 3: Theming & Visual Consistency

**Objective**: Enforce the design system by removing hardcoded values, aligning Tailwind with `theme.css`, and ensuring consistent light/dark support across public pages.

## Tasks

### 1. Inventory Theme Tokens
- Review `@client/theme.css` and catalog existing color, surface, text, accent, and gradient variables for both light and dark modes.
- Note any missing tokens (e.g., border, subtle text, overlay) that repeatedly appear as literals; add them to `theme.css` before usage.

### 2. Align Tailwind With Tokens
- Update `tailwind.config.js` `theme.extend.colors` (and other primitives like gradients if needed) to reference the `theme.css` variables.
- Ensure semantic groups exist (e.g., `brand`, `surface`, `text`, `accent`, `state/success/warn/danger`) with CSS variable-backed values for light/dark.
- Confirm `content` paths already include `@client/src/**/*.{js,jsx}` and adjust if new file types are added.

### 3. Audit and Replace Hardcoded Colors
- Search `@client/src` (including components, layouts, hooks, pages, and CSS) for color literals: `#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,6}`, `rgb(`, `rgba(`, `hsl(`, `hsla(`, and gradient strings.
- Replace literals with Tailwind classes that map to theme tokens or with CSS variables defined in `theme.css`.
- Remove duplicated one-off shades; consolidate to the shared tokens to avoid drift.

### 4. Component-Level Theme Polish
- Normalize high-visibility sections (Hero, Feature, Pricing, Footer, Auth screens, Glass cards) to use the shared tokens for background, border, text, and overlay/blur treatments.
- Ensure gradients and shadow/blur layers use tokenized values and remain legible in both modes; adjust opacity scales rather than new colors when possible.
- Keep component CSS scoped and avoid regressions by reusing existing utility classes plus minimal custom selectors.

### 5. Verification
- Run `npm run lint` to ensure no lint errors after refactors.
- Run `npm run build` to confirm Tailwind picks up the updated tokens and the client builds cleanly.
- Perform a quick manual visual check in `npm run client` (Home, About, Legal, Auth) to confirm color consistency and readability.
