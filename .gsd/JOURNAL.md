### Phase 3 Kickoff & Theming
- Added semantic state tokens (success/warning/danger/info) and mapped them, plus glass/glow tokens, into Tailwind for consistent theming.
- Removed remaining inline styles (layouts, badges, SVG fills) and tightened AppSection API to enforce CSS/Tailwind usage.
- Ran `npm run lint` and `npm run build`; both completed successfully.
